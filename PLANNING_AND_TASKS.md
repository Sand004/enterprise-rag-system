## üìù Code Action Log

### 2025-06-04 (Update 2)
- **Action**: Removed PowerPoint processing functionality
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/ingestion/__init__.py` - Removed PowerPointProcessor import
  - `src/api/ingestion.py` - Removed PPTX from allowed file types
  - `README.md` - Removed PowerPoint/PPTX references
  - `docs/API.md` - Updated API documentation to remove PPTX
  - `PLANNING_AND_TASKS.md` - Updated to reflect PowerPoint removal
- **Reason**: PowerPoint data is no longer needed for the system
- **Next Steps**: Focus on DOCX processor and other document types

### 2025-06-04
- **Action**: Major repository build-out
- **Files Created**: 50+ files including:
  - Core Python modules (ingestion, retrieval, generation, security)
  - API endpoints (health, auth, ingestion, search)
  - Docker and Kubernetes configurations
  - CI/CD pipeline
  - Comprehensive documentation
- **Key Implementations**:
  - Base document processing pipeline with PDF support
  - Semantic chunking with sentence embeddings
  - Vector store management with Qdrant
  - Hybrid search combining vector and keyword search
  - Reranking system with cross-encoder support
  - LLM generation with prompt management
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Encryption utilities
  - Multi-agent router for query classification
- **Next Steps**: Complete remaining processors, add GraphRAG, increase test coverage

### 2025-06-03
- **Action**: Created initial repository structure
